# Portfolio V2 - Main Site

This is the second version of my portfolio website, built as a static site deployed via GitHub Pages. It features improved design, responsiveness, and local asset hosting for better performance.

The UI is improved over v1, with a focus on catchy animations and smooth scrolling, with mordern award-winning design replication from [Patrick David](https://v1.bepatrickdavid.com/)

The site is deployed to the custom domain `aigamer.dev`.
